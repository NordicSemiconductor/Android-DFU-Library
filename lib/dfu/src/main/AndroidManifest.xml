    <!--
     On Android 12 new set of Bluetooth permissions were added. BLUETOOTH_SCAN permission is
     needed to scan for Bluetooth LE devices.

     This permission is not added here, as scanning is only required in some cases. If needed,
     add this permission to your app's Android Manifest.

     Also, consider adding "neverForLocation" flag if scanning for beacons is nor required.
     With this flag set, the Fine Location permission will not be required.

    Apps that target Android 9 (API level 28) or higher and use foreground services must request
    the FOREGROUND_SERVICE permission, as shown in the following code snippet.
    This is a normal permission, so the system automatically grants it to the requesting app.

    As foreground service may be disabled, this permission is commented out. Add it to your app
    if needed.

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
