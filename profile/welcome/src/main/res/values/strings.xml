    <string name="dfu_about_text">The Device Firmware Update (DFU) app allows updating the
		firmware of Bluetooth LE devices over-the-air (OTA). It is compatible with nRF51 and nRF52
        devices from Nordic Semiconductor running nRF5 SDK based applications with DFU bootloader enabled.
		\n\nFor more information about the DFU, see the About DFU section in Settings.
        \n\nTo update a nRF Connect SDK (NCS) based device, use nRF Connect Device Manager app instead.
